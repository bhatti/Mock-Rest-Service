   *** Mock Rest Service ***

This is a mock service for recording requests and responses to your REST API (or any web sever) and then playback.

Requirements:
   Java 1.6+
   Maven


Building
   Checkout code from 
      git clone git@github.com:bhatti/Mock-Rest-Service.git

   Typing
      mvn

Running in record mode
   mvn jetty:run-war -DMOCK_MODE=record -DMOCK_URL_PREFIX=http://myserver -DMOCK_FOLDER=/tmp/mocks

Running in play mode
   mvn jetty:run-war -DMOCK_MODE=play -DMOCK_URL_PREFIX=http://myserver -DMOCK_FOLDER=/tmp/mocks

Changing mode on the fly
   As part of HTTP request, you can pass mock_mode parameter with value of 'record' or 'play' for running the request in specific mode.

Specifying the key for request
   By default all GET requests are stored with a file name that is derived from all URL path and parameters and all POST requests are stored
based on the SHA1 hash of POST body or parameters. However, you can specify the key by passing parameter mock_key.
